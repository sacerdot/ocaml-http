In order to build ocaml-http you will need:

  - the ocaml compiler
    [ http://caml.inria.fr ]

  - findlib
    [ http://www.ocaml-programming.de/packages/documentation/findlib/ ]

  - ocamlnet
    [ http://sourceforge.net/projects/ocamlnet ]

  - pcre-ocaml
    [ http://www.ai.univie.ac.at/~markus/home/ocaml_sources.html ]

To build the bytecode library:

  $ make all

To build the nativecode library (only if you have an ocaml native code
compiler):

  $ make opt

To install the built stuff in the OCaml standard library directory (as root):

  # make install

To install the built stuff in another directory:

  $ make install DESTDIR=another_directory

To build a debian package of the library (please note that to build a debian
package you will also need some additional stuff like debhelper, fakeroot, ...):

  $ fakeroot debian/rules binary
